- LocalStorage and SessionStorage
- WebSQL
- IndexedDB

## Cookies

- Small data upto the size of 4KB, key-value pairs stored by the browser.
- Cookies are stored as strings and sent to the server on every subsequent request.
- Cookies are build as an extension of http protocol and because the http protocol is stateless.
- Updating a cookie and only way to update a cookie is create a new cookie with the same name.
- Deleting a cookie we need to update the cookie expiration time to a later or older time.

```txt
// cookie_name=cookie_value; expires=Sun, 16 Jul 3567 06:23:41 GMT; path=/; secure

Cookie = "
  key = value;
  expires = date;
  path = path; // to save on a specific place
  domain = domain;
  secure; // uses only https
"
```
