# [client-side-data-storage](https://github.com/murshidazher/client-side-data-storage)

> A workspace containing client-side data storage implementations. üöå üöå

- client-side data storage - saving data inside the browser itself.
- Check if your browser support the storage implementation using [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/).

## Technologies

Different storage technologies are available and each of the below listed technologies solves an individual problem,

- `Cookies`
- HTML5 WebStorage - `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`
- WebSQL - SQL based storage.
- IndexedDB - NoSQL based transactional storage.
- Offline Storage

The pros are;

- It improves performance
- reduces the load on the server
- Sandboxed - only a single origin can access the storage its assigned for.

## Cookies

> Stores as `string` upto `4KB`.

- Small data upto the size of 4KB, key-value pairs stored by the browser.
- Cookies are stored as strings and sent to the server on every subsequent request.
- Cookies are build as an extension of http protocol and because the http protocol is stateless.
- Updating a cookie and only way to update a cookie is create a new cookie with the same name.
- Deleting a cookie we need to update the cookie expiration time to a later or older time.

```txt
// cookie_name=cookie_value; expires=Sun, 16 Jul 3567 06:23:41 GMT; path=/; secure

Cookie = "
  key = value;
  expires = date;
  path = path; // to save on a specific place
  domain = domain;
  secure; // uses only https
"
```

## HTML5 Web Storage

> Stores as `key-value` pairs.

- Before HTML5 Web Storage there was cookies but with a limited storage of 4KB. Moreover, they sent the cookies on every request hence slowing down.
- Web storage attempts to provide client-side only storage with no interaction with server-side.
- Web storage provides two different types of storage,
  - `localStorage` - data isn't delete until the user manually deletes it  (persistent storage).
  - `sessionStorage` - data stored in the SessionStorage is temporary and cleared if the browser is closed. It only saved for a browser session.
- The main difference between these two types is the lifetime of the data not the functionality.
- If we open two browser with the same domain, session storage will not be in persisted in the same storage but the local storage will be available.

## WebSQL

> If you've enormous amount such that its not manageable by session storage or cookie. So we can only use the database.

- WebSQL is a database located in the browser.
- Before this we were only storing data as key-value pair but WebSQL uses table structure to store data. We can store more complex data and as many tables as we want.
- WebSQL uses SQLite for storing data in the background as database engine.

## IndexedDB

> Powerful, large-scale, transactional NoSQL database. ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't forget if you don't have large amounts of data, you shouldn't use database. If you do this the complexity of your application will be increased use local/session storage in this use-cases.  

- If we wanted to manage large amount of data in client-side we could use the WebSQL but it was the first attempt to add a database to client-side.
- The specification of WebSQL reached an impasse, because developer stopped using it due to it being tabular data and limited to SQL queries.
- IndexedDB is a NoSQL database where every operation is asynchronous.
- Its also a transactional database meaning we can rollback an operation if a query fails.
- Indexing is available in the IndexedDB.
